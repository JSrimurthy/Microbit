## Who
Tatsuya & J44m (Jaan)
## What
A robot that randomizes the brightness on the screen up to 3 million times
## How
We imported the Random Module and used this to concatinate a bunch of numbers (Converted to strings) in order to create a string similar to "00000:11111:22222:33333:44444"
## Why
it was a cool idea that was also challenging enough for the given time. We were also able to write some other functions, using other imported modules.
